window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively written for Audible, available only in audio </b></p> <p>Sleep is central to every part of our lives, and a good night's sleep begins by putting aside the day's worries. But in today's technology-saturated world, saying goodnight to the day is harder than ever. Allow author Arianna Huffington (<i>Thrive</i>, <i>The Sleep Revolution</i>) to guide you to a peaceful night's slumber as she performs <i>Goodnight Smartphone</i>: a classic tale reborn for the modern age, when the hardest thing to say goodnight to is not the moon but our phones, our email, our social media, our always-on digital selves.&nbsp;</p> <p>During a visit to Audible to speak about the benefits of sleep, Arianna joked about what a wonderful book <i>Goodnight Moon</i> is and how other childhood classics help transition kids from daytime to sleep time. She posited why there weren't such books for adults. \"Goodnight cares of the day, goodnight worries about tomorrow, goodnight laptop!\" she exclaimed. Soon after, <i>Goodnight Smartphone</i> was born. Listen as Arianna borrows from the traditions of children's bedtime stories to create this modern age adaptation for adults, and learn more about her daily sleep regimen in her introduction. Exclusively written for Audible, available only in audio.</p> <p>Inspired by children's bedtime classics, this audiobook is a playful and relaxing guide to help you transition from the worries of a stressful day to a good night's sleep, and you can hear it only on Audible.&nbsp;</p>";
