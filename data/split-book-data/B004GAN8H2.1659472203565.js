window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Go On Girl! Book Club Pick</b></p> <p>Ralph Elllison's <i>Invisible Man</i> is a monumental novel, one that can well be called an epic of 20th-century African-American life. It is a strange story, in which many extraordinary things happen, some of them shocking and brutal, some of them pitiful and touching - yet always with elements of comedy and irony and burlesque that appear in unexpected places.&nbsp;</p> <p>After a brief prologue, the story begins with a terrifying experience from the hero's high-school days; it then moves quickly to the campus of a \"Southern Negro college\" and then to New York's Harlem, where most of the action takes place.&nbsp;</p> <p>The many people that the hero meets in the course of his wanderings are remarkably various, complex and significant. With them he becomes involved in an amazing series of adventures, in which he is sometimes befriended but more often deceived and betrayed - as much by himself and his own illusions as by the duplicity and the blindness of others.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Invisible Man</i> is not only a great triumph of storytelling and characterization; it is a profound and uncompromising interpretation of the anomalous position of Blacks in American society.&nbsp;</p>";
