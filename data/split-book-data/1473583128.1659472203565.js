window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.</p> <p>In the start of an all-new series, the best-selling author of <i>Uprooted</i> and <i>Spinning Silver</i> introduces you to a dangerous school for the magically gifted where failure means certain death - until one girl begins to rewrite its rules.</p> <p>Enter a school of magic unlike any you have ever encountered.</p> <p>There are no teachers, no holidays, friendships are purely strategic and the odds of survival are never equal.</p> <p>Once you’re inside, there are only two ways out: you graduate or you die.</p> <p>El Higgins is uniquely prepared for the school’s many dangers. She may be without allies, but she possesses a dark power strong enough to level mountains and wipe out untold millions - never mind easily destroy the countless monsters that prowl the school.&nbsp;</p> <p>Except, she might accidentally kill all the other students, too. So El is trying her hardest not to use it...that is, unless she has no other choice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wry, witty, endlessly inventive and mordantly funny - yet with a true depth and fierce justice at its heart - this enchanting novel reminds us that there are far more important things than mere survival.</p>";
