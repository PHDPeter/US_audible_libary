window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Four classic comedies from one of the wittiest playwrights in Western literature: <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i>, <i>A Woman of No Importance</i>, <i>An Ideal Husband</i>, and <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, all featuring star-studded casts with the likes of Jacqueline Bisset, Miriam Margolyes, James Marsters, Alfred Molina, Roger Rees, Yeardley Smith, Eric Stoltz, and many more. This audio also includes a chilling dramatization of Wilde's sole novel, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i></b><b>:</b> <br> The irreverent satire that launched Wilde's succession of classical comedies. A lord, his wife, her admirer, and an infamous blackmailer converge in this delicious comic feast of scandal. A divinely funny comedy of good girls, bad husbands, and the moral hypocrisy of British high society in the late 19th century. Stars Roger Rees, Eric Stoltz, Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Going, Gina Field, Judy Geeson, Arthur Hanket, Lisa Harrow, Dominic Keating, James Warwick, and Tom Wheatley. Directed by Michael Hackett.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>A Woman of No Importance</i></b><b>:</b> <br> Devilishly attractive Lord Illingworth is notorious for his skill as a seducer. But he is still invited to all the \"best\" houses while his female conquests must hide their shame in seclusion. In this devastating comedy, Wilde uses his celebrated wit to expose English society's narrow view of everything from sexual mores to Americans. Stars Rosalind Ayres, Jane Carr, Peter Dennis, Judy Geeson, Paul Gutrecht, Martin Jarvis, Cherie Lunghi, Robert Machray, Miriam Margolyes, Samantha Mathis, and Jim Norton.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>An Ideal Husband</i></b> <br> A tender love story, a glittering setting in London society, and a shower of witticisms are only a few of the reasons this play has enjoyed hugely successful revivals.</p>";
