Now that her worst fears have been confirmed, Susan learns that she's expected to take over the family business when she grows up, even though most people mistake her for the Tooth Fairy. But as attractive as Death can be to many people, Susan is drawn into something else: the exciting, addictive heavy beats of 'Music with Rocks In,' Discworld's latest dance craze.</p> <p><b>Please note: This is a vintage recording.
