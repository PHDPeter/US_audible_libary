window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Following the release of his best-selling autobiography, <i>Believe Me: A Memoir of Love, Death and Jazz Chickens</i>, Eddie Izzard spoke to us about history, politics, books... and funky poultry. </p><p>As a transgender artist, Eddie explains how a steadfast ambition has helped him to overcome discrimination and prejudice, long enough to make it in the world of Hollywood. Now a hugely successful comedian and actor who's starred alongside the likes of Dame Judi Dench, George Clooney and Julia Roberts, Eddie takes a look back at his favourite roles and co-stars. </p><p>Eddie has also always been a firm supporter of the Labour party and, in this interview, hints at pursuing a future as a member of parliament â€“ a well thought-out plan which he delves into further in his audiobook. </p><p>Written and performed in the keenly intelligent, wholly honest and predictably hilarious style that we have come to expect from Eddie, his audiobook <i>Believe Me</i> has been hailed by critics for its commentary on historical and sexual politics, mad ancient kings and chickens with guns. A critic wrote of it: </p><p>\"Izzard is one of the funniest people alive, a talented actor, a sharp cross-dresser, an experienced marathon runner, and a great writer. You will have to read this if only to find out what a jazz chicken is.\" (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>) </p>";
