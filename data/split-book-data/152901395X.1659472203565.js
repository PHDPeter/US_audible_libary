When his father, Montrose, goes missing, 22-year-old army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, accompanied by his uncle George - publisher of <i>The Safe Negro Travel Guide -</i> and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite - heir to the estate that owned one of Atticus’ ancestors - they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.</p> <p>At the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawn - led by Samuel Braithwhite and his son Caleb - which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly centres on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of his - and the whole Turner clan’s - destruction.</p> <p>An imaginative blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of two Black families, Matt Ruff's <i>Lovecraft Country</i> is a devastating kaleidoscopic portrait of racism - the terrifying spectre that continues to haunt us today.</p>";
