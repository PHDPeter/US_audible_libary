window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away… </i></p> <p>Best-selling <i>Star Wars</i> veteran James Luceno gives Grand Moff Tarkin the <i>Star Wars: Darth Plagueis</i> treatment, bringing a legendary character from <i>A New Hope</i> to full, fascinating life. </p> <p>He’s the scion of an honorable and revered family. A dedicated soldier and distinguished legislator. Loyal proponent of the Republic and trusted ally of the Jedi Order. Groomed by the ruthless politician and Sith Lord who would be Emperor, Governor Wilhuff Tarkin rises through the Imperial ranks, enforcing his authority ever more mercilessly….and zealously pursuing his destiny as the architect of absolute dominion. </p> <p>Rule through the fear of force rather than force itself, he advises his Emperor. Under Tarkin's guidance, an ultimate weapon of unparalleled destruction moves ever closer to becoming a terrifying reality. When the so-called Death Star is completed, Tarkin is confident that the galaxy’s lingering pockets of Separatist rebellion will be brought to heel - by intimidation…or annihilation. </p> <p>Until then, however, insurgency remains a genuine threat. Escalating guerrilla attacks by resistance forces and newfound evidence of a growing Separatist conspiracy are an immediate danger the Empire must meet with swift and brutal action. And to bring down a band of elusive freedom fighters, the Emperor turns to his most formidable agents: Darth Vader, the fearsome new Sith enforcer as remorseless as he is mysterious; and Tarkin - whose tactical cunning and cold-blooded efficiency will pave the way for the Empire's supremacy…and its enemies' extinction. </p>";
