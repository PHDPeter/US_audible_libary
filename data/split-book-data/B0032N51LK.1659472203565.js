window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mort, like many teenagers, is gangly, unpromising, and struggling with a menial job - in his case, as Death's apprentice. He can barely handle his simple task of ushering souls out of Discworld, but he really screws up when he meets the beautiful Princess Keli, who is scheduled to be assassinated. Going against his boss's wishes, Mort kills Keli's assassin instead, which angers and interferes with Fate. But Mort's heroism seems to be for naught, since Discworld proceeds as though Keli had been killed, while Death has too much fun drinking and gambling to be any help. This is the fourth book in the Discworld series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p><p><b><b>Please note: This is a vintage recording.
