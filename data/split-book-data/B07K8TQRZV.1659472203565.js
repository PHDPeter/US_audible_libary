window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joining us in the Audible Studios to talk about not one but two recent audio projects is actor and comedian Matt Lucas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Matt is well known for <i>Little Britain</i> and <i>Come Fly with Me</i> but has many more strings to his bow - adding the narration of Charles’ Dickens epic <i>Great Expectations</i> to his achievements, along with performing Fagin in the audio drama <i>Dodge and Twist</i>. At a finished time of 20 hours and 39 minutes long, narrating <i>Great Expectations</i> was no mean feat. It has, though, been met with rave reviews - so time well spent!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In this interview Matt discusses his audio performances so far, which characters he’d love to voice in the future and which one in a bag of Revels no one wants.&nbsp;</p>";
