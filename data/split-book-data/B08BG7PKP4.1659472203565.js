window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Become mindfully awake as you sharpen your focus on each of your senses. Deep breaths and the music of shruti and chimes underscore this guided meditation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jesse Israel was a successful music executive running his own label when debilitating anxiety and panic attacks forced him to step back and seek help. When he found meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way. He founded The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprah’s 2020 Vision Tour with WW).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Guided by leading experts and personalities in wellness, morning meditations are brief listens focused specifically on helping you start your day on the right foot. They don’t require any previous experience - they're easy to get into and designed to help you take a moment each morning to simply check in with yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This title is part of the Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up in the right morning mindset. New and free for members.</p>";
