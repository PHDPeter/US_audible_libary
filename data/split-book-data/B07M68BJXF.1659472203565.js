window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Parker Avery takes Olivia Nelson's case, it sends her, Kay, and Iris to Nelspruit in search of a missing watch, but they soon find out the watch is more than a sentimental possession. It is an efficient device used to disarm large safes and assist in burglaries, and Olivia Nelson isn't the only one after it. The Avery Detective Agency finds themselves in conflict with a local group of criminals that want the watch just as much as they do, and in the midst of chaos, they are at risk of more than just losing a case.</p>";
