window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Visualize your life as a series of different rooms, and see each room filled with the powerful golden light of your own self-compassion and fullest potential. Let go of your doubts and fears and start the day experiencing your best self.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jackie Cantwell is the sound meditation practitioner of The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprah’s 2020 Vision Tour with WW). It was founded by Jesse Israel, whose own experience with debilitating panic attacks forced him to step back from a successful career as a music executive to seek help. When he came upon meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Guided by leading experts and personalities in wellness, morning meditations are brief listens focused specifically on helping you start your day on the right foot. They don’t require any previous experience - they're easy to get into and designed to help you take a moment each morning to simply check in with yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This title is part of the Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up in the right morning mindset. New and free for members.</p>";
