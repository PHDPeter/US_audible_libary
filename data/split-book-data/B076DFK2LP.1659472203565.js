window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audible presents a special edition of three Gothic tales for the price of one: a brand-new Audible Exclusive recording of Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> (ch2), Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> (ch12) and Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> (ch39).&nbsp;</p> <p>Bursting with intrigue and suspense, they resurrect the deepest and darkest of all our fears: that a monster lurks, and it lurks within us.&nbsp;</p> <p>Introductions by Dr Maria Mellins and Dr Peter Howell, Senior Lecturers in Gothic literature at St Mary's University, London, this collection offers additional insight into these audiobooks, their authors and their legacies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Starting with Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, Richard Armitage tells the story of a conflicted man who seeks to free the monster inside him from the clutches of his conscience.&nbsp;</p> <p>Following his celebrated performances of <i>David Copperfield</i> and David Hewson's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> for Audible, Armitage delivers another powerhouse performance as the narrator of this Gothic tale.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shilling shocker enthusiast Stevenson was celebrated throughout his life. In contrast to Mary Shelley, who was often overshadowed by her husband's work, Stevenson lived comfortably by his pen.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was only with the release of <i>Frankenstein</i> that Shelley finally distinguished herself. <i>Frankenstein</i> was groundbreaking in its ability to fuse passion and romance with gore and horror.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated by Dan Stevens, who rose to fame through <i>Downton Abbey</i>, and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, the story of science student Victor Frankenstein has been artfully retold.&nbsp;</p> <p>Testing the limits of science, Frankenstein fashions a living being from the conjoined body parts of rotting cadavers. Horrified at the end result, he abandons his monster, leaving him to endure a life of isolation and loneliness.&nbsp;</p> <p>A poignant example of human weakness and our inability to take responsibility for our actions, <i>Frankenstein</i> is both moving and terrifying.&nbsp;</p> <p>That leads us to the gruesome tale of Count Dracula, the bloodthirsty father of the undead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated by Greg Wise, star of <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>; Greg depicts a young lawyer whose services are hired by a sinister Transylvanian count.&nbsp;</p> <p>Releasing <i>Dracula</i> 80 years after <i>Frankenstein</i>, Bram Stoker was greatly influenced by Shelley's writing style and similarly propels the story along through diary entries, letters and newspaper cuttings. Possessed of grisly imagery and unexpected twists, it's no wonder that <i>Dracula</i> still manages to shake us to our very core.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that remains is to offer a note of caution: this collection is not for the fainthearted. Old as these tales may be, do not mistake the unsettling nature of their content.&nbsp;</p> <p>Grab some popcorn, turn the speakers up and enjoy. Just don't say we didn't warn you.</p>";
