window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i> and its prequel, <i>Dawn of the Dreadfuls</i>, were both <i>New York Times</i> best sellers, with a combined 1.3 million copies in print. Now the PPZ trilogy comes to a thrilling conclusion with <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dreadfully Ever After</i>. </p> <p>The story opens with our newly married protagonists, Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy, defending their village from an army of flesh-eating unmentionables. But the honeymoon has barely begun when poor Mr. Darcy is nipped by a rampaging dreadful. Elizabeth knows the proper course of action is to promptly behead her husband (and then burn the corpse, just to be safe). But when she learns of a miracle antidote under development in London, she realizes there may be one last chance to save her true love - and for everyone to live happily ever after. </p>";
