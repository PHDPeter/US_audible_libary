window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whether navigating the backroads of Louisiana or Thuringia, exploring the snowy Quebec woods, or performing onstage at Rush concerts, Neil Peart has stories to tell. His first volume in this series, <i>Far and Away</i>, combined words and images to form an intimate, insightful narrative that won many fans. Now <i>Far and Near</i> brings together reflections from another three years of an artist's life as he celebrates seasons, landscapes, and characters; travels roads and trails; receives honors; climbs mountains; and composes and performs music. With passionate insight, wry humor, and an adventurous spirit, once again Peart offers a collection of open letters that take listeners on the road, behind the scenes, and into the inner workings of an ever-inquisitive mind. These popular stories, originally posted on Peart's website, are now collected and contextualized with an introduction and conclusion.</p>";
