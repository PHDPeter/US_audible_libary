window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>English mentalist and illusionist, Derren Brown, talks to us about the release of his latest audiobook, <i>Happy</i>, and how he believes we can attain peace of mind and solidity within ourselves. </p><p>Quoting some of the greatest philosophical minds of the past, Derren explains why he has found affinity with the Stoics and their approach in the pursuit of happiness. Also presenting a highly critical view of modern self-help books, Derren argues against the suggestion that we can control the uncontrollable; the universe will not give you what you desire simply because you ask for it. </p><p>First introduced to British audiences through a series of programmes entitled, <i>Mind Control</i>, Derren has been demystifying the subtle art of magical and psychological manipulation for 17 years. With his new audiobook, <i>Happy</i>, he agrees that he's moving on to similar but perhaps more intellectual pastures. </p><p>Describing <i>Happy</i> as an 'anti-self-help self-help book', Derren Brown wills his listeners to live in the present and think of happiness as a by-product and not an end in itself. </p>";
