window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Marie Benedict, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Only Woman in the Room</i>, <i>The Mystery of Mrs. Christie</i>, and co-author of <i>The Personal Librarian</i>, comes a captivating work of historical fiction about a young female spy who may have changed the course of American history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The tide is turning against the colonists in the Revolutionary War, and 18-year-old Elizabeth Morris cannot sit by idly. Quietly disdainful of her Tory parents, who drag her along to society events and welcome a British soldier into their home during their occupation of New York City, Elizabeth decides to take matters into her own hands. She realizes that, as a young woman, no one around her believes that she can comprehend the profound implications of being a nation at war - she is, effectively, invisible. And she can use this invisibility to her advantage. Her unique access to British society leads her to a role with General George Washington's own network of spies: the Culper Ring.</p> <p>Based on true events, <i>Agent 355</i> combines adventure, romance, and espionage to bring to life this little-known story of a hero who risked her life to fight for freedom against all odds.</p>";
