window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is a short vignette featuring the world's greatest detective and his sidekick - but is it truly a \"lost\" Sherlock Holmes story? Listen for yourself and decide.... </p><p>In 1904 the Scottish town of Selkirk held a three-day event to raise funds to replace a wooden bridge destroyed in a flood two years earlier. As part of the event, the organizers sold a story collection called <i>The Book o' the Brig</i>. Most of the stories were written by locals - but one stood out because it starred Holmes and Watson. </p><p>It wasn't until 2015 that an 80-year-old Selkirk resident named Walter Elliot, who long owned a copy of the book, leafed through it and came upon the previously unpublished story. His discovery of \"Sherlock Holmes: Discovering the Border Burghs and, by Deduction, the Brig Bazaar\" caused quite a stir. </p><p>But was the story truly written by Conan Doyle? What's known is that the renowned author enjoyed visiting the area in and around Selkirk. And his name appears in the book, indicating that he was the opening presenter on the Saturday of the fundraising event. But Holmes experts have their doubts, since there is no mention of the story in Conan Doyle's papers, and the style of writing doesn't ring true. So the mystery may never be solved. But it is a fact that the fundraising effort succeeded - and a brand-new iron bridge was built. </p>";
