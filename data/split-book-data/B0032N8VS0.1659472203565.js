As the alien clich√©s of Tinsel Town pour into the world, it's up to the Disc's first film stars to find out....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Thrill, as Victor Tugelbend (\"Can't sing. Can't dance. Can handle a sword a little\") and Theda Withel (\"I come from a little town you've probably never even heard of\") battle the forces of evil and cinema advertising....</p> <p>Scream, as Gaspode the Wonder Dog nearly saves the day....</p> <p>Eat popcorn as you watch the filming of <i>Blown Away</i>, the oddest Civil War picture ever made, 'A Passionate Saga set Against the Background of a World Gone Mad! With a Thousand Elephants!'
